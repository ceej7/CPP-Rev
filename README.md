# CPP-Rev
Advanced C++ and C++11 new feature review/training. Reviewing C++ with the intention of penetrating into CG. Thus basic function will not be involved in this review.
## Part1. Intro
1. Compile and link
   - Procedure   
     ![img](./img/Img01-Procedure.png)
   - Compile  
     ![img](./img/Img02-Complie.png)  
     - Compiler checks the code whether it follows the rules of the C++ language.  
     - Then translate the C++ source code into a machine language (.o)
   - Link  
     ![img](./img/Img03-Link.png)  
     - Combine generated obj files into an executable one.
     - Add on a library file <- C++ STL


## Reference
Learning within online course is not recommended(basically time-consuming). It's better to read reference material if you have a programming foundation. As for the material, here you go.
